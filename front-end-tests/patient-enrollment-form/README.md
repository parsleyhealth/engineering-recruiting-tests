# Ingest Form Application

### Overview

In this task you'll be creating a simple, **React** application, that consists of a form and a data visualization screen.

> If you have any questions email me at guayo@parsleyhealth.com.

### Prompt

#### Form

We would like you to create a **multi-step** or **multi-screen** patient ingest
form that gathers standard medical data. See [fixtures](./fixtures.md) for example questions, data and terms.


Here is a suggested organization of the form, but use your best judgement and
creativity:

1.  **Demographic data**: name, email, address, birthdate, etc
2.  **Diseases**: List diseases by category. Control should be filterable and selections persist between filter selection changes. See [diseases](./diseases.json)
3.  **Medical questions**: Questionnaire.  
3.  **Summary**: Show the patient a summary screen with their selections and provide a mechanism for them to go back and edit any mistakes
4.  **Submit**: Show terms and checkbox to accept and a button to submit.
    On submit, please print the payload you collected to the console. This is your fake API submission.

### Time limits

Please turn in your results within **72-hours** of the prompt being given. If
that falls during the weekend, then please turn it in by Monday.

> Extensions are available, just ask!

### Evaluation & priorities

We don't expect you to create something perfect and highly polished — 
Limit yourself to 4 - 6 hours working time. We hope in that time
you'll consider the following.  


1.  **Make it work!**:  Even if you don't complete the assignment, it must run and compile.
2.  **Clean and clear code** (hopefully you didn't sacrifice this to make it work)
3.  **Organization** Think about how to structure your project
4.  **Planning**: Tools used, implementation strategy, basic UX concerns like what
    to ask for where
5.  Management of **data, state, and events** internally
6.  **Make it look good**: Just use [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/),
    [ant design](https://ant.design/docs/react/use-with-create-react-app) or another
    UI kit you're comfortable with.
7.  **Tests** Highly desireable but 100% coverage is not expected for this exercise.
8.  **README** Description, getting started, ect.

### Delivery of project

Please place your finished source code on GitHub, Gitlab, or send us a zip file.
